## Election Analysis

### Overview of Election Audit
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given us the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election. Since we are asked to automate the whole audit process in order to use for senatorial and local elections, we will use [Python](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb/) for this project.<br/>

### Purpose

- The voter turnout for each county
- The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
- The county with the highest turnout
- The total number of votes cast
- The total number of votes for each candidate
- The percentage of votes for each candidate
- The winner of the election
